Problems
--------
1. Apps that use this library are purging the classes in production.  As a temporary work around the developer must specify an 
   empty array for purge files in the tailwind.config.js file.  This needs to be fixed so that unused classes can be properly
   purged in production.


To Do Items
-----------
1.  [ ] - Dashboard layout is too high.  The whole screen scrolls up.  It should only scroll inside main area.  It does this because the
    header is at that top.
